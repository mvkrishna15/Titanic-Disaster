# Titanic Survival Prediction and Data Analysis 🚢

## Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset, providing insights into passenger survival patterns, demographics, and key factors influencing survival during the historic maritime disaster.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze the Titanic passenger dataset
- Understand survival patterns across different demographics
- Investigate factors influencing passenger survival
- Perform comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing
- Create insightful visualizations

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Source**: Titanic passenger dataset
- **Total Passengers**: 891
- **Columns**: 
  - PassengerId
  - Survived
  - Pclass (Passenger Class)
  - Name
  - Sex
  - Age
  - Fare
  - Embarked
  - Family Size (derived)

## 🔍 Key Findings
1. **Survival Statistics**
   - Overall Survival Rate: 39%
   - 1st Class Survival: 28.37%
   - Female Survival: 40.63%

2. **Demographic Insights**
   - Male Passengers: 64%
   - Average Passenger Age: ~30 years
   - Fare Range: $0 - $512

3. **Class-based Observations**
   - 1st Class passengers had higher survival rates
   - Fare variations across classes:
     * 1st Class: Up to $263
     * 2nd Class: Up to $77
     * 3rd Class: Up to $68

4. **Embarkation Point Insights**
   - Most passengers embarked from 'S' port
   - 'C' port had more 1st class passengers
   - 'Q' port had fewer passengers with lower survival rates

## 🛠 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Created family size feature
- Imputed missing age and fare values
- Removed unnecessary columns

## 📈 Visualization Techniques
- Seaborn and Matplotlib used for analysis
- Visualizations include:
  - Survival count plots
  - Age distribution
  - Fare distribution
  - Class-based survival
  - Gender-based survival

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script

## 🔬 Detailed Analysis
Refer to the Python script for comprehensive step-by-step data cleaning, analysis, and visualization process.

## 📝 Conclusions
- Female passengers had higher survival rates
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive
- Age and family size played roles in survival probability

## 🌟 Recommendations
- Improve safety measures for lower-class passengers
- Develop more inclusive emergency protocols
- Consider family dynamics in emergency planning

## 📌 Future Work
- Develop predictive machine learning models
- Deeper statistical analysis
- Create interactive visualizations
